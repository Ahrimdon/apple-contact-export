Python script that Extract contacts from itunes backup (ios 13) and save it as csv file.
Just change the full path where the file is (line: 13 in script).
for windows: \Users\(username)\AppData\Roaming\Apple Computer\MobileSync\Backup\ and look for the file name: 31bb7ba8914766d4ba40d6dfb6113c8b614be442 (this file we using to extract the contacts).
And that's it! once you have full path, you can run the script. And also you can change the output file path(and name ofcourse) at line: 34.
